# VerAnon Admin UI

## Purpose

The VerAnon Admin UI provides a web interface for manual protocol operations, serving both identity managers and service providers. While automated solutions may be preferred in production environments, this interface ensures direct protocol accessibility and operational visibility.

### For Identity Managers

- Monitor group metrics and membership
- Verify individual identity commitment status and addition dates
- Process user requests through commitment management (add/remove/update)
- View subscriber details and account information
- Adjust fee structures

### For Service Providers

- Track user verification status across account set
- Adjust approved identity managers
- Access account details including approved manager relationships
- View and verify manager credentials and reputation

This interface serves as an essential tool for protocol participants to maintain oversight of their operations and execute manual interventions when needed.
